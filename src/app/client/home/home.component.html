          The TOEICÂ® tests are the global standard for assessing English-language proficiency for the workplace.
          The TOEIC tests accurately measure listening, reading, speaking, and writing skills.
          The tests are used by organizations to make hiring and placement decisions, as well as to determine training
          needs.
          TOEIC test scores provide meaningful feedback about a test-taker's strengths and weaknesses, along with a
          description of the English-language strengths typical of test-takers performing at various score levels.
